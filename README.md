# AlzAR

# Inspiration
This project was inspired by my grandfather, who battled Alzheimer's a few years ago. One aspect I noticed in his struggle was that there were moments when he would look at an object or 
a picture and have some recognition emerge. With this in mind, I created AlzAR to emulate this process using the power of VR.

# How I built it
I used HTML5, CSS, and Bootstrap for the front-end. For the back-end, I used echoAR, as it allowed me to store all the 3D models and images on the platform.

# Challenges I ran into
One of the largest challenges was that for some reason, DevPost deleted the descriptions I had wrote for this project. So I am writing it now :). Using echoAR was initially a challenge
because of me being a beginner, but gradually I became more used to its intuitive UI and it became very easy. Firebase proved the largest challenge for me, and unfortunately I was never
able to integrate it into the website.

# Accomplishments that I'm proud of
As a beginner, my knowledge of front-end languages like HTML and CSS/Bootstrap were not very strong. I'm proud especially of learning Bootstrap and echoAR, and using those two
to build a responsive application that utilizes the power of AR.

# What I learned
Further knowledge with HTML and CSS, new knowledge with Bootstrap and echoAR. Learned how to manipulate 3D models and insert text as well.

# What's next for AlzAR 
Initial goals will focus on integrating Firebase to provide a customized experience for users to access their own 3D models, use echoAR API to upload/download 3D models, and more. The final end goal will be a complete web/phone application that provides digital AR tools for dementia patients, incorporating ideas like 3D modeling of their own objects, AR memory games, canvas drawing, and more. The power of AR is in its immersive potential
